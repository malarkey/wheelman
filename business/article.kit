<h3>Why we value privacy</h3>

<p>We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we&#8217;re committed to keeping your information safe. We&#8217;re uncomfortable with the information law enforcement keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from our customers. We&#8217;ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you gave it, and we&#8217;ll never give anyone access to it, especially the law.</p>

<h3>How we collect information</h3>

<p class="alt--inset">We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we&#8217;re committed to keeping your information safe.</p>

<p>We ask for contact information including your name, email address, and phone number, on our website so that we can reply to your enquiry. Our website doesn&#8217;t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you visit. We don&#8217;t use Google Analytics or native social media &#8216;like&#8217; or &#8216;sharing&#8217; buttons which also build profiles of your internet activity.</p>

<h3>What information we hold</h3>

<ul>
<li>When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name, email address, phone number, a social 	media username, and the firm you work for, if you&#8217;ve given us that.</li>
<li>If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect your email address.</li>
<li>When you buy something from us, we collect your name, 	email address, phone number, and a delivery address.</li>
<li>If you do business with us, we also collect your business 	name and bank details and keep records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.</li>
<li>All purchases are processed by Swindlify, our ecommerce platform and we never have access to your credit card information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where we store information</h3>

<p class="alt--inset">We can&#8217;t tell you who&#8217;s responsible for your information, but you can contact them by email.</p>

<p>If you sign up for a newsletter, we store your email address in MailCrook, which is the marketing platform we prefer. When you buy something, your information is stored in Swindlify, our ecommerce platform, and if we do business, we store your information in our accounts software offline.</p>

<h3>How we use your information</h3>

<p>We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our products and services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we won&#8217;t send them to you again. We might also email or phone you about our products and services, but if you tell us not to, we won&#8217;t get in touch again. We will use your information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.</p>

<h3>Who has access to information</h3>

<p>We can&#8217;t tell you who&#8217;s responsible for the security of your information, but you can contact them by email if you have any concerns about the information we store. When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access. Our management team have access to everything you&#8217;ve provided, but individual employees have access to only what they need to do their job.</p>

<h3>Steps to keep information private</h3>

<p class="alt--inset">We don&#8217;t use Google Analytics or social media &#8216;like&#8217; or &#8216;sharing&#8217; buttons.</p>

<p>Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people who need it. We store passwords in 1Password, an encrypted password manager, use a different, randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice. The computers we use are all encrypted using Bank Vault and are protected by a passcode or fingerprint access. These computers ask for authentication whenever they&#8217;re started or after 5 minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition.</p>

<h3>Changes to this policy</h3>

<p class="alt--endmark">If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we publish them on our website.</p>
