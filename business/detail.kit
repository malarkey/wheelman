<p class="alt--accent">Save by covering all jobs under one policy</p>

<p class="alt--dropcap">Cover multiple jobs with your policy and save 10&#37; off our cut of your loot. Multi-job insurance is a way to cover all your getaway cars under a single policy. There&#8217;s one price for them all, which means less paperwork. One multi-job policy can include different types of cover with individual add-ons and excesses. Each getaway driver has their own no claim discount. So, if one vehicle crashes, the discounts for everyone else won&#8217;t be affected.</p>

<p class="alt--accent">With Wheelman Multi-job insurance, you can save by insuring several types of jobs with one combined policy</p>
