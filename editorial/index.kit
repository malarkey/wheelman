<h1><a href="/editorial/article.html">The dumbest robber ever?</a></h1>
<time>November 20 2023</time>
<p class="alt--dropcap">In aiming to be one of Britain’s criminal masterminds, Raymond Betson yesterday sealed his legacy as possibly the most hopeless. The bungling career criminal, jailed for the failed Millennium Dome diamond heist in 2000, was starting another sentence after a raid on a Kent cash depot with a mechanical digger went disastrously wrong. He and his unknown accomplices dreamed of recreating the record-breaking 2007 Securitas raid in which more than &#163;53million was spirited away. But they smashed through the wrong wall—which led them to an empty room rather than the vault of cash they were expecting.</p>

<p>A gang of fifteen, led by Bruce Reynolds, attacked the train. Other gang members included Buster Edwards and Ronnie Biggs. After the robbery, police found their hideout and evidence led to the arrest of the gang. The ringleaders were sentenced to 30 years in prison.</p>

<h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Antwerp diamond heist</a></h2>
<p>Dubbed the &#8220;heist of the century,&#8221; this was the largest ever diamond heist. Thieves stole gold, diamonds, silver, and jewellery worth &#36;100million. It took place in Belgium in 2003. Though arrests were made, most of the diamonds remain unrecovered.</p>

<h2><a href="javascript:void(0)">Bank robbery an inside job?</a></h2>
<p>In a highly sophisticated operation, a gang of three masked men held the families of two Northern Bank cash clerks hostage at gunpoint. From then on, the gang had uninterrupted access to the bank. Experts, including the FBI, believe the Northern Bank robbery was an inside job.</p>
