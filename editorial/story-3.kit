<p class="alt--dropcap">The Antwerp diamond heist—dubbed the &#8220;heist of the century&#8221;&#8212;was the largest ever diamond heist and one of the largest robberies in history. Thieves stole loose diamonds, gold, silver and other types of jewellery valued at more than &#36;100 million. It took place in Antwerp, Belgium, during the weekend of 15&#8211;16 February 2003. Though arrests were made and time was served, most of the diamonds stolen remain unrecovered.</p>

<p>The vault that housed the diamonds is situated two floors below the main floor. It was protected by multiple security mechanisms, including a lock with 100 million possible combinations, infrared heat detectors, a seismic sensor, Doppler radar, and a magnetic field. The building itself had a private security force and was located in the heavily guarded and monitored Antwerp diamond district.</p>

<p>Leonardo Notarbartolo had rented a furnished office for approximately in the Antwerp World Diamond Centre. There, he posed as an Italian diamond merchant to gain credibility. The robbery required
eighteen months of preparation.</p>

<p>The theft was carried out by a five-man team led by Leonardo Notarbartolo, a professional thief who was skilled in social manipulation. Notarbartolo was arrested after being connected to the crime by DNA evidence from a partially eaten salami sandwich found near the crime scene.</p>

<p class="alt--endmark">Notarbartolo was found guilty of orchestrating the heist. He is considered to be the leader of a ring of Italian thieves called &#8220;La Scuola di Torino&#8221; (The School of Turin,) who carried out the crime. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison by the court of appeal of Antwerp in 2005.</p>
