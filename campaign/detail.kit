<p class="alt--accent">We&#8217;re funded by donations from members of the public, not from the proceeds of any robbery</p>

<p class="alt--dropcap">After masterminding several magnificent&#8212;but unfortunately unprofitable&#8212;heists over a career spanning 60 years, for the past five years, Brian has gone straight at One for the Road.</p>

<p>Located just outside Southend-on-Sea, One for the Road is a home for retired get-away drivers who&#8217;ve hung up their driving gloves. Our residents have swapped Fury Road for a back road and exchanged the fast lane for a country lane. Having put their criminal pasts behind them, our old lags like nothing more than a game of dominos and a cup of milky tea.</p>

<p>Opened in 1965, One for the Road has 20 bedrooms, a games room, and a lounge where our residents can socialise and reminisce about the jobs they pulled. Although get-away drivers have priority, One for the Road is also available to cat burglars, forgers, and safe crackers over the age of 70. We&#8217;re funded by donations from members of the public, not from the proceeds of any robbery.</p>
